Using embedded graphs
=====================

Doxygen allows you to embed different types of graphs with various commands. Doxyrest will convert
those embedded graphs into sphinx directives using sphinx extensions to render them. If you haven't
enabled the correct extension, the graphs will not be shown. For configuration of those extensions
see the documentation of them.

dot
    Directed and undirected hierarchical graphs generated by graphviz. Uses extension
    ``sphinx.ext.graphviz`` shipped with sphinx.

msc
    Message sequence charts generated by mscgen. Uses extension ``sphinxcontrib.mscgen``.

plantuml
    UML graphs rendered with plantum. Uses extension ``sphinxcontrib.plantuml``
