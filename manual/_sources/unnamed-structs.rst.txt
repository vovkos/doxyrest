Unnamed Structs/Unions
======================

Doxygen has a major flaw in its XML model for unnamed C/C++ structs or unions. The problem is that it's impossible to reconstruct the original declaration *just* from the generated XML database.

For example, the following snippet:

.. code-block:: cpp

	struct Parent
	{
		int m_field1;

		struct
		{
			int m_field2;
			int m_field3;
		};

		int m_field4;
	};

\... *AND* the following snippet:

.. code-block:: cpp

	struct Parent
	{
		struct
		{
			int m_field1;
			int m_field2;

			struct
			{
				int m_field3;
			};
		};

		int m_field4;
	};

\... both yield the same XML:

.. code-block:: mxml

  	<compounddef>
  		<!-- struct Parent -->

    	<memberdef>
    		<!-- int m_field1 -->
	  	</memberdef>

    	<memberdef>
    		<!-- int m_field2 -->
	  	</memberdef>

    	<memberdef>
    		<!-- int m_field3 -->
	  	</memberdef>

    	<memberdef>
    		<!-- unnamed member of type Parent::@0 -->
	  	</memberdef>

    	<memberdef>
    		<!-- int m_field4 -->
	  	</memberdef>
  	</compounddef>

I have omitted the gory details of the Doxygen XML, but it should be enough to demonstrate the point -- Doxygen XML alone is simply ambiguous!

We have to somehow add extra information, but we don't want a reader of our documentation to see that. Solution -- ``\internal`` sections!

In your ``Doxyfile``, add this alias:

.. code-block:: none

	INTERNAL_DOCS = YES
	ALIASES += "unnamed{1}=\internal :unnamed(\1) \endinternal"

In your C/C++ code, add this special comment to the very first field of the unnamed struct:

.. code-block:: cpp

	struct Parent
	{
		union
		{
			//! \unnamed{union}
			int m_field1;
			int m_field2;
		};

		int m_field3;
	};

In case of nested unnamed structs, you have to also provide:

1. path to the field in the unnamed struct;
2. the number of fields in this unnamed struct.

.. code-block:: cpp

	struct Parent
	{
		union
		{
			struct
			{
				//! \unnamed{union/struct:2}
				int m_field1;
				int m_field2;
			};

			struct
			{
				//! \unnamed{union/struct:3}
				int m_field2;
				int m_field3;
				int m_field4;
			};
		};

		int m_field5;
	};

.. note::

	It's OK to inject ``\unnamed`` anywhere into a documentation block for the first member, for example:

	.. code-block:: cpp

		//! This is documentation \unnamed{union} for m_field1
