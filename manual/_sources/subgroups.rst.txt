Subgroups
=========

Doxygen groups (``\groupdef``, ``addtogroup``, etc) produce separate pages by design -- as such, they cannot be used to group members together. However, often times a bunch of members relate so closely to one another that they simply do *not deserve* a dedicated documentation block for each and every one of them. We would like to have *one block* for a *subgroup* of closely related members -- and display these members as such, i.e. together.

Doxyrest provides a facility just for that -- *subgroups*.

In your ``Doxyfile``, add this alias:

.. code-block:: none

	INTERNAL_DOCS = YES
	ALIASES += "subgroup=\internal :subgroup: \endinternal"

In your C/C++ code, add this special comment to the very first member in the subgroup:

.. code-block:: cpp

	/*!
		\subgroup

		Functions ``foo()``, ``bar()``, and ``baz()`` do similar things
		with a few minor differences, as outlined here: ...

	*/

	void foo();
	void bar();
	void baz();

In your final documentation, you will have all three functions grouped together as such:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	void foo()
	void bar()
	void baz()

Functions ``foo()``, ``bar()``, and ``baz()`` do similar things with a few minor differences, as outlined as outlined here: ...

.. note::

	Why not have something like ``\groupdef``, but for members on the same page?

	Well, in my opinion, that would be a *wrong thing* to do. We already have two levels of member grouping:

	* By protection level (``public``, ``protected``, etc);
	* By member kind (variables, functions, etc).

	Adding yet another level of grouping -- *to the same page* -- would destroy the nice compound overview we have right now and would be unintuitive to comprehend.

	If there really is a need to subdivide members (of a class, for instance), the proper approach would be to adjust the API itself (i.e. subdivide related members between subclasses).
