Doxyrest Manual
===============

Doxyrest is a compiler from **Doxygen** XML to **reStructuredText** -- hence, the name. It parses XML database generated by `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_, feeds it to Lua-based *string template engine* and produces reStructuredText suitable for being passed further on to Python documentation generator `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.

The main purpose of Doxyrest is to generate beautiful Sphinx-based documentation for C/C++ APIs. But not just that!

Doxygen can be replaced with your own parser tool capable of producing Doxygen-compatible XML databases. Lua frames used for generation of reStructuredText can also be replaced with your own ones. It means that both the input and the output of Doxyrest are *100% customizable* -- and without re-compilation!

To rephrase, Doxyrest could be used to produce customizable documentation/stats/reports for APIs written in *any programming language*!
